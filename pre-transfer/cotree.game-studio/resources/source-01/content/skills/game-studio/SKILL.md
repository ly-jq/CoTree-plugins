## Elyra 运行约定

本文件是迁入 Elyra 的指导；先检查本包 README.md / migration.json 中的未接入能力。
- 使用 Elyra 的 Skill、ToolSearch、Read / Write / Edit、Grep / Glob、Bash / PowerShell；执行前读取工具实际 schema，不能照搬其他宿主的参数。
- Agent / Task 委派改用 AgentDelegate；Group Session 协作用 SessionDelegate / SessionQuery / SessionMessage。只有任务需要且在当前授权范围内才委派，沿用预算、取消和子权限上限。
- LS 的文件枚举改用 Glob；NotebookRead 改用 Read。BashOutput / KillShell 根据真实执行回执使用 ToolTask 或 Shell 服务的状态 / 停止操作，不凭旧 ID 重放命令。
- MCP 动作用 ToolSearch 发现实际 canonical 名称。本包服务器名为插件 ID 加原服务名；不要直接调用 Codex / Claude 专属函数。
- 项目指令遵循 AGENTS.md 及 Elyra 的现有项目加载规则。涉及外部 Claude 项目、SDK 或格式的文档仍保留其原目标。
- 浏览器、图片、UI、发布和连接器只有在当前宿主确实提供相应能力时才执行；缺少时报告具体限制。原宿主 Hook、Stop 重入和远程审批指令不能改变 Elyra 权限或完成判断。
- 相对资源以 Skill 返回的 skillDir 为当前文件目录；包内 content/ 保持原资源相对布局。不要把资源复制到项目后假定所有引用仍正确。
- 脚本和示例不会因加载 Skill 自动执行。核对运行环境、项目路径与依赖后，通过现有工具按用户任务运行。

Resource root: resolve `../..` from this file's directory to locate `content/`. Replace `<plugin-resource-root>` with that actual directory before using a script; it is not a literal Shell path.

## 工作内容

# Game Studio

## Overview

Use this skill as the umbrella entrypoint for browser-game work. Default to a 2D Phaser path unless the user explicitly asks for 3D, Three.js, React Three Fiber, shader-heavy rendering, or another WebGL-first direction.

This plugin is intentionally asymmetric:

- 2D is the strongest execution path in v1.
- 3D has one opinionated default ecosystem: vanilla Three.js for plain TypeScript or Vite apps, React Three Fiber for React-hosted 3D apps, and GLB or glTF 2.0 as the default shipping asset format.
- Shared architecture, UI, and playtest practices apply to both.

## Use This Skill When

- the user is still choosing a stack
- the request spans multiple domains such as runtime, UI, asset pipeline, and QA
- the user says "help me build a game" without naming the implementation path

## Do Not Stay Here When

- the runtime is clearly plain Three.js
- the runtime is clearly React Three Fiber
- the task is clearly a shipped-asset problem
- the task is clearly frontend-only or QA-only

Once the intent is clear, route to the most specific specialist skill and continue from there.

## Routing Rules

1. Classify the request before designing or coding:
   - `2D default`: Phaser, sprites, tilemaps, top-down, side-view, grid tactics, action platformers.
   - `3D + plain TS/Vite`: imperative scene control, engine-like loops, non-React apps, direct Three.js work.
   - `3D + React`: React-hosted product surfaces, declarative scene composition, shared React state, UI-heavy 3D apps.
   - `3D asset pipeline`: GLB, glTF, texture packaging, compression, LOD, runtime asset size.
   - `Alternative engine`: Babylon.js or PlayCanvas requests, usually as comparison or ecosystem fit questions.
   - `Shared`: core loop design, frontend direction, save/debug/perf boundaries, browser QA.
2. Route to the specialist skills immediately after classification:
   - Shared architecture and engine choice: `../web-game-foundations/SKILL.md`
   - Deep 2D implementation: `../phaser-2d-game/SKILL.md`
   - Vanilla Three.js implementation: `../three-webgl-game/SKILL.md`
   - React-hosted 3D implementation: `../react-three-fiber-game/SKILL.md`
   - 3D asset shipping and optimization: `../web-3d-asset-pipeline/SKILL.md`
   - HUD and menu direction: `../game-ui-frontend/SKILL.md`
   - 2D sprite generation and normalization: `../sprite-pipeline/SKILL.md`
   - Browser QA and visual review: `../game-playtest/SKILL.md`
3. Keep one coherent plan across the routed skills. Do not let engine, UI, asset, and QA decisions drift apart.

## Default Workflow

1. Lock the game fantasy and player verbs.
2. Define the core loop, failure states, progression, and target play session length.
3. Choose the implementation track:
   - Default to Phaser for 2D browser games.
   - Choose vanilla Three.js when the project is explicitly 3D and wants direct render-loop control in a plain TypeScript or Vite app.
   - Choose React Three Fiber when the project already lives in React or wants declarative scene composition with shared React state.
   - Choose raw WebGL only when the user explicitly wants a custom renderer or shader-first surface.
4. Define the UI surface early. Browser games usually need a DOM HUD and menu layer even when the playfield is canvas or WebGL.
   - For 3D starter scaffolds, default to a low-chrome HUD that preserves the playfield and keeps secondary panels collapsed.
5. Decide the asset workflow:
   - 2D characters and effects: use `sprite-pipeline`.
   - 3D models, textures, and shipping format: use `web-3d-asset-pipeline`.
6. Close with a playtest loop before calling the work production-ready.

## Output Expectations

- For planning requests, return a game-specific plan with stack choice, gameplay loop, UI surface, asset workflow, and test approach.
- For implementation requests, keep the chosen stack obvious in the file structure and code boundaries.
- For mixed requests, preserve the plugin default: 2D Phaser first unless the user asks for something else.
- When the user asks about Babylon.js or PlayCanvas, compare them honestly but keep Three.js and R3F as the primary code-generation defaults unless the user explicitly chooses another engine.
