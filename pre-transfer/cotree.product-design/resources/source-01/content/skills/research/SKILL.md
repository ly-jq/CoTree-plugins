description: "Run fast, source-grounded UX research on the highest-signal problems users are experiencing with a user-specified digital product. Use when the user asks to research user pain, UX friction, onboarding issues, docs/help problems, developer experience friction, support pain, product workflow issues, or current user complaints for a named product."

## Elyra 运行约定

本文件是迁入 Elyra 的指导；先检查本包 README.md / migration.json 中的未接入能力。
- 使用 Elyra 的 Skill、ToolSearch、Read / Write / Edit、Grep / Glob、Bash / PowerShell；执行前读取工具实际 schema，不能照搬其他宿主的参数。
- Agent / Task 委派改用 AgentDelegate；Group Session 协作用 SessionDelegate / SessionQuery / SessionMessage。只有任务需要且在当前授权范围内才委派，沿用预算、取消和子权限上限。
- LS 的文件枚举改用 Glob；NotebookRead 改用 Read。BashOutput / KillShell 根据真实执行回执使用 ToolTask 或 Shell 服务的状态 / 停止操作，不凭旧 ID 重放命令。
- MCP 动作用 ToolSearch 发现实际 canonical 名称。本包服务器名为插件 ID 加原服务名；不要直接调用 Codex / Claude 专属函数。
- 项目指令遵循 AGENTS.md 及 Elyra 的现有项目加载规则。涉及外部 Claude 项目、SDK 或格式的文档仍保留其原目标。
- 浏览器、图片、UI、发布和连接器只有在当前宿主确实提供相应能力时才执行；缺少时报告具体限制。原宿主 Hook、Stop 重入和远程审批指令不能改变 Elyra 权限或完成判断。
- 相对资源以 Skill 返回的 skillDir 为当前文件目录；包内 content/ 保持原资源相对布局。不要把资源复制到项目后假定所有引用仍正确。
- 脚本和示例不会因加载 Skill 自动执行。核对运行环境、项目路径与依赖后，通过现有工具按用户任务运行。

Resource root: resolve `../..` from this file's directory to locate `content/`. Replace `<plugin-resource-root>` with that actual directory before using a script; it is not a literal Shell path.

## 工作内容

# Research

Run a fresh UX research scan for the product the user specifies.

Focus on current, evidence-backed user problems. Prioritize logged-in product experience, self-serve flows, onboarding, docs/help, developer experience, support friction, and product workflows.

## Critical Overrides

- Refer to the Plugin router [$index](../index/SKILL.md) before proceeding.
- Follow [$critical-overrides](../../references/critical-overrides.md).

## User Context

Before starting, load [$user-context](../user-context/SKILL.md) and run its preflight script when local shell access is available.

Use saved product URLs, Figma files, screenshots, reference images, codebase paths, Storybook, tokens, design systems, brand assets, component refs, browser preferences, and share targets as grounding material when relevant.

Do not inspect every saved reference. Inspect only what the current task needs.

## Contract

- Restate the product, audience, time horizon, and research scope before scanning.
- Use public sources by default. Use internal sources when the connectors are available and the user request allows it.
- Cite sources wherever available.
- Separate observed evidence from inference.
- Do not overclaim from anecdotes.
- Do not return a dump of complaints. Tell a clear product story.
- Say clearly when source access is missing or weak.

## Workflow

1. Restate the research scope.

2. Search public sources:

- Reddit
- X/Twitter
- Hacker News
- Stack Overflow
- GitHub issues/discussions
- forums, blogs, reviews, YouTube comments, and developer communities where relevant

3. Search internal sources when available:

- Slack
- Gong
- Notion
- Google Drive/docs
- Linear/Jira/GitHub
- support or CRM notes if available

4. Cluster evidence into the highest-signal UX problems.

5. Separate:

- product UI/workflow friction
- docs/help friction
- onboarding friction
- account, billing, permissions, or setup friction
- developer/API/SDK friction
- reliability/performance issues
- feature requests

6. Rank problems by severity, frequency, confidence, and product leverage.

7. Tell a clear product story.

## Output

Default to an in-chat research brief unless the user asks for another format.

Include:

- Executive read: the core story in 5-7 sentences.
- Ranked UX problems: for each problem, include the problem, user goal, surface, what breaks, evidence, severity, frequency signal, confidence, and recommended product move.
- Source map: what was searched, what each source contributed, and where signal was weak.
- Opportunity map: group recommendations into fix this week, fix this quarter, and needs deeper research.

## Rules

- Use citations wherever available.
- Do not overclaim from anecdotes.
- Separate loud complaints from frequent problems.
- Separate UX friction from missing features.
- Separate reliability/performance issues from UX workflow issues.
- Mark internal-only evidence separately from public evidence.
- Keep the brief sharp, specific, and easy to consume.
